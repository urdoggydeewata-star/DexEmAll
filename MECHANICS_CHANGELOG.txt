DexEmAll Mechanics Changelog

Purpose:
- Track gameplay/mechanics changes only (fixes, balance, command behavior, encounters, evolution rules, UI behavior tied to mechanics).
- Do NOT store code-level implementation details here.

Update rule:
- Append every new mechanics-facing change to this file (newest first).
- Keep entries short and player-facing.

Format:
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC | short-hash | mechanics summary

2026-02-20 07:38 UTC | ac46cc16 | Normalized legacy stat-stage key aliases during battle state updates so stage-changing status moves remain consistent even with older stage data.

2026-02-20 07:22 UTC | 81b31827 | Fixed status-stage handling so Growl-style debuffs apply consistently and corrected /team sprite size scaling so small species no longer render oversized.

2026-02-20 06:38 UTC | 12dfc30d | Applied starter-style 12.5% female ratio handling to owner give/import creation flows so gifted starter species use the same sex odds.
